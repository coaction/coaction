Sorry for that, no time for more at this moment. In that demo, we can see that coaction is able to mimic sailsjs framework behaviour, reading it's config files, like routes and policies, using waterline type based models, server-client models sync + how to levarage [Consolidator](https://github.com/consolidator) events mechanism to sync coaction events across multiple server instances using dnode protocol (one of few consolidator-pubsub bridges).
